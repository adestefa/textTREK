textTREK Story 1

Your name is Dr. Walter Landen you are part of a expedition to an uncharted island. Until five years ago, no one knew it existed. A rather large block of land about twenty miles across in the South Pacific. 

It was discovered by your collegue James Waters, who was a bit of a celebertiy in the Acrchelogy community for discovering the island, until he went missing. 

Five years after James began searching the island with a small crew, no one has heard from him. No evidence accept one transmission that left the island two weeks ago. It was a weak signal so most of the message was lost. James in his own voice saying something about water and the sun, that part was scrambled, but the next was very clear.. "...but that doesn't matter now, it is too late. What ever you do, don't come here, if you..." then the message scrambled again and was lost.

Thinking about the message, you keep coming back to 'water'. Was he just telling us his name, or did he mean actual water?. Also the sun, what does that have to do with anything? And why is it too late? The questions mount.

As the only living person alive that knows Waters work as well, you have been hired, to go find out what happend to James, and finish his work. As leader of this expedition, you have been given twenty men, two months supplies and some of the latest high-tech gear. 

You are on a large boat, with your crew and supplies. You are on course for the island and should be coming up on it any minute now. You left port late and have arrived late at night.

You hear the crew shouting outside the cabin and get up to investigate. you make your way up to the bridge where the captian is driving the boat. "Walter, glad you are here, we need all the eyes we can get".

You look out the window and see two crew members on the bow directing spot lights out into the dark inky ocan. THeir beams cut through the night like a sharp kinfe.
