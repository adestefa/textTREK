# textTREK
A text adventure in C++.

I always wanted to write my own text-driven adventure game, do more with less philosophy.  Here I revisit old-school gaming while exploring how to incorporate new unrelated gameplay elements on the cmd line.

==========

Your name is Dr. Walter Landen you are part of a expedition to an uncharted island. Until five years ago, no one knew it existed. A rather large block of land about twenty miles across in the South Pacific.

It was discovered by your colleague James Waters, who was a bit of a celebrity in the archaeology community for discovering the island, until he went missing.

Five years after James began searching the island with a small crew, no one has heard from him. No evidence but a single transmission that left the island two weeks ago. It was a weak signal so most of the message was lost. James in his own voice saying something about water and the sun, that part was scrambled, but the next was very clear.. "...but that doesn't matter now, it is too late. Whatever you do, don't come here, if you..." then the message scrambled again and was lost.

Thinking about the message, you keep coming back to 'water'. Was he just telling us his name, or did he mean actual water?. Also the sun, what does that have to do with anything? And why is it too late? The questions mount.

As the only living person alive that knows Waters work as well, you have been hired to go find out what happened to James, and finish his work. As leader of this expedition, you have been given twenty men, two months supplies and some of the latest high-tech gear.

You are on a large boat with your crew and supplies. You are on course for the island and should be coming up on it any minute now. You left port late so you have arrived late at night. This night is especially dark as there is also a lot of fog on the water.

You hear the crew shouting outside the cabin and get up to investigate. you make your way up to the bridge where the captain is driving the boat. You stand at the bridge bulkhead "Permission to board Captain?", "Walter, glad you are here, we need all the eyes we can get, please board." The captain says with a hint of fear in his voice.

You look out the window and see two crew members down on the bow of the ship, directing spot lights out into the dark inky ocean water, trying their hardest to spot any side of land or rocks. Their thick beams cut through the night like

a sharp knife, but the fog prevents them from reaching very far. it is like making their way through thick black soup.

"How many times have you made this trip?" you ask. The captain answers in his Trinidad island accent, "Four times, counting this one. I will tell you the same thing I told your friend Mr Waters, I don't like the feeling of this place if there is such a thing. Out in the middle of nowhere, I can't shake the feeling this place shouldn't exist!" He continues to inches the boat further. That's when the first mate spotted it first.

"Captian!" his voice comes over the hand-held radio, "We have to turn.." and with that his voice cuts out and the second mate screams so loud we could hear it through the thick glass of the bridge and the powerful engines of the boat.

The Captain puts the boat at full stop, gets up and flips a switch which energizes a strip of floodlights he has under the bridge, it lights the deck but also blinds the crew even more from the black sea.

You both see the first mate's body, cut in half on the deck. The Second mate is covered in blood and standing over the bisected body in shock screaming. Although the engine is off, the boat is still has forward momentum so it continues to drift forward with no one watching the path.

The Captain lunges to the control panel and hits two toggle switches and both anchors drop from the bow of the boat. He glances at the digital depth finder display, "200 meters", that's about 700 feet of anchor line, current is around ten knots so should hit bottom about 120 seconds."

The anchor line continues to spool out from the payload coil. "Any more line and I am going to run out, we only have fifteen hundred feet. The boat continues to drift, the line pay out and the second mate has stopped screaming. He stands motion over his friends body. The Captain turns to you "Go down to the deck and replace the second mate on a search light, take this radio and message me if you see anything."

You turn for the door as you hear the captain complain he just ran out of anchor line. "It is like the bottom is glass, I can't get a hold, hurry!" You turn leave the bridge down the small staircase to the main deck. The mess is even worse down here, the second mate is frozen in shock, you make your way past them and pick up the search light. You look back at the bridge, the captain turns off the bridge flood lights, as you switch yours on. You peer over the side of the boat, shining the light into the black fog ahead. You can see only a few feet of water at once. You watch the boat slice through the water, it is really very calm, almost like a lake, you think to yourself. The water seems black too, so much more scary than normal, but somehow also, almost hypnotic, relaxing.

It is also very quiet with the engines off and no one making any sounds. Erie quite. The radio cracks to life and you jump as the captain's voice comes over "Walter, stay focused!"

Just as you click the radio to return an answer, you spot a shape in the water, grey and rising out, a ROCK, "ROCK ROCK, I SEE A ROCK DEAD AHEAD" you scream over the radio, the captain puts the engines in full reverse, but it is too late, the boat hits the rock and it goes right through the front bow, the impact knocks you forward off your feet, you grab the rail and lose the flood light over the side as the boat comes to a stop. The boat starts to back up now and you can hear more cracking of the bow as the rock rips free from the fiberglass hull.

The boat instantly starts to take on water and canter forward. The captain turns the flood lights on again, but that only makes the fog even brighter. The second mate was thrown down on impact, he gets up and starts yelling for the captain as you feel your feet get cold as the water rises to your ankles. Using the rail you pull your way up hill towards the bridge, away from the sinking front bow. The bottom half of the first mate slides past you as the boat increases its pitch. The second mate starts to lose his balance, he spots you and lunges, grabbing around your neck as he holds on for dear life screaming.

He is choking your neck, you feel your grip loosen, you grasp for air as you start to lose consciousness. You try to scream but nothing comes out.

You feel the water at your feet again, this time it is now rising faster and is already at your knee, you let go of the rail and plunge into the thick black ocean. It is as cold as arresting, the second mate is still holding tight as you both fall quickly under together. Looking up, you still see the bridge floodlights above the water and the darker outline of the boat as it is sinking above you both. You kick as hard as you can but no luck. You think this is it, you're not going to make it. Panic sets in, you kick again as hard as you can, knocking the second mate lose this time.  FREE at last!

Now you feel each kick from your legs push you upwards, the boat is now mostly sunken and very close and the floodlights are still on shining, now into the think sea. 

As the last air bubbles exscape out of the cabin, the boat finally falls under the water line.

Then the floodlights go out.

The last thing you feel was the boat hitting your head.
